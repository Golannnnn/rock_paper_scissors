# rock_paper_scissors
My third project as part of 'The Odin Project' curriculum. 
Here is the live preview: https://golannnnn.github.io/rock_paper_scissors/

What I learned, used and improved:
- basic javascript
  - declaring variables
  - functions
  - methods
  - statements
  - DOM manipulation

- a better understanding of flexbox
- cleaner HTML code
  - not just using `<div>` tags and taking advantage of all the different tags
